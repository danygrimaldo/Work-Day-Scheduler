# Work Day Scheduler

A simplistic calendar app that would allow the user to save events on an hourly basis based on a traditional 9am - 5pm schedule. I was able to work with HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and Jquery to accomplish the functionality of this project. 

## How To:

1.  Enter the activity into the text column in accordance to the the correct time you would want the event to take place and click save.

2.  As the time goes by, the current slot will be filled with a predetermined color to show you what activity  is currently taking place, have ended, or will take place throughout the work day.

3.  After the 5:00 hour completes, the color will default back for all slots.
